# Pills-Tablets Page Development Log

## Overview
Created the `/pills-tablets` category product listing page for oral weight loss medications (Orlistat, Xenical, Alli). Built with modularity and reusability principles, leveraging components from the injections page while creating new specialized sections.

## Components Built

### 1. Reusable Components Enhanced
**CrossSellProductCard** (`/components/cross-sell-product-card.tsx`)
- Enhanced with flexible color schemes (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Reusable across different product categories
- Consistent hover effects and responsive design

**CrossSellSection** (`/components/cross-sell-section.tsx`)
- Generic cross-sell section accepting product arrays
- Customizable titles, descriptions, and color schemes
- Background image support for visual variety

**ExpertAdviceCTA** (`/components/expert-advice-cta.tsx`)
- Made reusable with configurable content and color schemes
- Flexible props for title, description, CTA text and links
- Supports primary, secondary, tertiary color themes

**FAQsSection** (`/app/(products)/components/faqs-section.tsx`)
- Enhanced to accept FAQ data as props
- Reusable across different product categories
- Maintains accordion functionality with shadcn/ui

### 2. Pills-Specific Components

#### PillsComparisonSection (`/app/(products)/components/pills-comparison-section.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Compare different pill medications with detailed specifications

**Features**:
- Responsive design: mobile cards → desktop sticky table
- Compares 3 pill options: Orlistat, Xenical, Alli
- Detailed comparison including dosage, effectiveness, side effects
- Sticky header for desktop table view

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
{
  name: string
  price: string
  description: string
  activeIngredient: string
  howItWorks: string
  effectiveness: string
  sideEffects: string[]
  dosage: string
  suitableFor: string[]
}
```

#### HowItWorksSection (`/app/(products)/components/how-it-works-section.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Pills-specific process explanation and local delivery info

**Features**:
- 3-step process: Consultation → Prescription → Delivery
- Local delivery emphasis with "next day delivery"
- Zinc color scheme for neutral, informative tone
- Responsive grid layout (1→3 columns)

## Page Structure (`/app/(products)/pills-tablets/page.tsx`)

### Product Data
**Pills Products Array**:
- **Orlistat**: £12/week, generic option
- **Xenical**: £15/week, brand name version  
- **Alli**: £8/week, lower dose OTC option

### Layout Structure
1. **Hero Section**: CategoryHero with pills-specific content
2. **Products Grid**: 3 pill options using ProductCard components
3. **Pills Comparison**: Detailed medication comparison table
4. **Expert Advice CTA**: Professional consultation promotion
5. **How It Works**: Pills-specific process explanation
6. **Cross-sell Injections**: Promote injection products with tertiary color scheme
7. **FAQs Section**: Pills-specific frequently asked questions

## Technical Implementation

### Component Reusability Strategy
**Successfully Reused**:
- `CategoryHero` - Same component, different content
- `ProductCard` - Identical implementation for pills
- `CrossSellProductCard` - Enhanced with color schemes
- `CrossSellSection` - Generic implementation
- `FAQsSection` - Made reusable with props

**New Components Created**:
- `PillsComparisonSection` - Pills need different data structure than injections
- `HowItWorksSection` - Pills-specific process information
- `ExpertAdviceCTA` - Enhanced existing with reusability

### Styling Consistency
- Maintained primary purple color scheme for main content
- Used tertiary colors for cross-sell sections (visual hierarchy)
- Consistent hover effects and transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns

### Data Management
**Pills Comparison Data**:
```typescript
const pillsData = [
  {
    name: "Orlistat",
    price: "£12/week",
    description: "Generic prescription weight loss medication",
    activeIngredient: "Orlistat 120mg",
    howItWorks: "Blocks absorption of dietary fats",
    effectiveness: "5-10% weight loss in 6 months",
    sideEffects: ["Oily spotting", "Gas with discharge", "Urgent bowel movements"],
    dosage: "120mg three times daily with meals",
    suitableFor: ["BMI ≥30", "BMI ≥28 with risk factors"]
  }
  // ... additional pills
]
```

**Pills FAQs Data**:
```typescript
const pillsFaqs = [
  {
    question: "How do weight loss pills work?",
    answer: "Weight loss pills work in different ways..."
  }
  // ... 7 comprehensive questions
]
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Component Reusability vs Specificity
**Issue**: Pills need different comparison data structure than injections
**Solution**: Created separate `PillsComparisonSection` while keeping shared components truly reusable

### Challenge 2: Color Scheme Differentiation  
**Issue**: Need visual hierarchy between main content and cross-sell sections
**Solution**: Implemented color scheme props (primary, secondary, tertiary) for flexible theming

### Challenge 3: Content Flexibility
**Issue**: Same components need different content across pages
**Solution**: Enhanced components with comprehensive props interfaces for content customization

### Challenge 4: Mobile Image Sizing
**Issue**: Product images too large on mobile (inherited from injections page)
**Solution**: Fixed by removing `min-h-[368px]` from ProductCard component, affecting both pages

## Performance Considerations
- Reused existing components to minimize bundle size
- Lazy loading for below-fold sections
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Minimal JavaScript for interactive elements (accordion)

## Files Created/Modified
- `/app/(products)/pills-tablets/page.tsx` - Main pills page
- `/app/(products)/components/pills-comparison-section.tsx` - Pills comparison table
- `/app/(products)/components/how-it-works-section.tsx` - Pills process explanation
- `/components/cross-sell-product-card.tsx` - Enhanced with color schemes
- `/components/cross-sell-section.tsx` - Generic cross-sell section
- `/components/expert-advice-cta.tsx` - Enhanced with reusability
- `/app/(products)/components/faqs-section.tsx` - Enhanced with props
- `/components/product-card.tsx` - Fixed mobile image sizing

## Reusability Achievements
1. **CrossSellSection**: Now used on both injections and pills pages
2. **FAQsSection**: Enhanced to accept different FAQ data
3. **ExpertAdviceCTA**: Flexible content and color schemes
4. **ProductCard**: Works across all product categories
5. **CategoryHero**: Fully reusable across category pages

## Next Steps
1. Create bariatric-surgery category pages using same component patterns
2. Build individual product detail pages (`/pills-tablets/orlistat`, etc.)
3. Implement shopping cart integration
4. Add navigation between related products
5. Consider A/B testing different component variants

## Development Principles Applied
- **Modularity**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components work across different contexts
- **Consistency**: Maintained design language and patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized for loading speed and user experience
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design from ground up

This page demonstrates successful component architecture that balances reusability with specific functionality needs.
