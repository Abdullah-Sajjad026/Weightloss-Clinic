      "Regent Pharmacy was recommended to me for WEIGHT LOSS by an Assistant in a Shop. Booking a health check was really simple. Service from Shaz in the Pharmacy was excellent and I can highly recommend. Follow up support is available face to face (much better than an app). I am saving Â£70 per month on previous supplier and it is a local service which I really like to support.",

      "Amazing service from Regent Pharmacy! I was seen quickly and efficiently by the staff and in particular Ahmed, who was incredibly helpful and attentive. I came to the pharmacy for a second opinion after not feeling listened to at another pharmacy and immediately Ahmed made me feel listened to. He gave me his professional advice and after a quick trip to A&E, I returned to the pharmacy within the hour to pick up my prescription. Thank you so much for your hard work and attentiveness, as well as your genuine care for customers! :)",
